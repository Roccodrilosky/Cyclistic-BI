# Cyclistic BI Project

## Background: 

In this fictitious workplace scenario, the imaginary company Cyclistic has partnered with the city of New York to provide shared bikes. Currently, there are bike stations located throughout Manhattan and neighboring boroughs. Customers are able to rent bikes for easy travel among stations at these locations.

## Scenario:

You are a newly hired BI professional at Cyclistic. The companyâ€™s Customer Growth Team is creating a business plan for next year. They want to understand how their customers are using their bikes; their top priority is identifying customer demand at different station locations.

### Welcome to Google Fiber! 
Congrats on your new job with the business intelligence team at Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in New York City. In order to provide your team with both BI business value and organizational data maturity, you will use your knowledge of the BI stages: capture, analyze, and monitor. By the time you are done, you will have an end-of-course project that demonstrates your knowledge and skills to potential employers.
