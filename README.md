# Cyclistic BI Project

## Background: 

In this fictitious workplace scenario, the imaginary company Cyclistic has partnered with the city of New York to provide shared bikes. Currently, there are bike stations located throughout Manhattan and neighboring boroughs. Customers are able to rent bikes for easy travel among stations at these locations.

## Scenario:

You are a newly hired BI professional at Cyclistic. The companyâ€™s Customer Growth Team is creating a business plan for next year. They want to understand how their customers are using their bikes; their top priority is identifying customer demand at different station locations.
